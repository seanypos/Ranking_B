Alvin: Alvin has been testing the unittest framework in python, and using Flask to create an api to 
  communicate with indexing. 
Reilly: Reilly is creating an API to converse with the querying component.
He created test inputs that we may receive from querying. Use 4 spaces instead of tabs
Sean: Built JSON testing files for link analysis (sending and recieving). Add missing quotation marks in JSON.

We reviewed Reilly.py (our main script) so that we all understood and are up to date with recent changes. 
After all of us were on board Alvin continued leading the research on flask for the api, while Sean
worked on what we would be returning through the api's (the json format) and fiddling with the numbers of the
weighting system for each data recieved from other projects (ie, from indexing, link analysis). 
Reilly worked on click through rate recieved from quering and some of the jsons related to that as well.
